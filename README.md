# Simple Reflex Vacuum Agent

## Introduction
This project is a simulation of the Simple Reflex Vacuum Agent. The code is written in Python 3 using the tkinter library for GUI and PIL library for image processing. The environment consists of two locations A and B, which can be either clean (0) or dirty (1). The vacuum cleaner is randomly placed in one of the locations at the start of the simulation and has to clean the dirty location by changing its state from 1 to 0.

## Requirements
Python 3
Tkinter library
PIL library

## Running the simulation
To run the simulation, simply run the simplereflexvacuumagent.py file using the following command in the terminal:

## Conclusion
This simulation demonstrates the behavior of a simple reflex vacuum agent in a two-location environment. The code can be easily extended to simulate more complex environments and agents.
